# trips-server

The purpose of this project is to build a showcase application of production ready quality. I plan on extending this application with more features as mentioned in the TODO section. This API will be consumed by various frontend frameworks to test my skills in those frontend frameworks.

## Features

-   CRUD operations on trips and user entities.
-   Admins can create and manage a trip.
-   Users can create accounts and then sign up for trips.
-   Server tracks trip details and lists attending users.
-   Authorisation on routes using JSON web Tokens.
-   Mongoose ORM over mongodb.
-   MVC Pattern.
-   Request Authentication using refresh tokens.
-   Password encryption.
-   Reusable modular component design, separation of concerns.

## Tech Stack

-   Typescript
-   Node
-   express
-   mongoose / mongodb
-   dotenv
-   JSON web tokens

# TODO

-   Frontend written in Angular can be found here.
-   Add e2e and unit tests.
-   Hosted on Heroku with CI/CD pipeline.
-   Docker for local mongodb instance.
-   logger for server side logging.
-   Automate postman API route testing.
-   Process to generate API documentation.
